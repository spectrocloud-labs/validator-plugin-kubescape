# validator-plugin-kubescape
The Kubescape [validator](https://github.com/spectrocloud-labs/validator) plugin validates against Kubescape to provide information regarding vulnerabilities.

## Description
The Kubescape validator plugin reconciles `KubescapeValidator` custom resources to perform the following validations against your Kubescape API:

1. Specify cluster CVE severity limits
2. Flag cluster if specific CVE is found within cluster

Each `KubescapeValidator` CR is (re)-processed every two minutes to continuously ensure that your network matches the expected state.


## Installation

The Network validator plugin is meant to be installed by validator (via a ValidatorConfig), but it can also be installed directly as follows:

```
helm repo add validator-plugin-kubescape https://spectrocloud-labs.github.io/validator-plugin-kubescape
helm repo update
helm install validator-plugin-network validator-plugin-network/validator-plugin-kubescape -n validator-plugin-kubescape --create-namespace
```

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster
1. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/
```

2. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/validator-plugin-kubescape:tag
```

3. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/validator-plugin-kubescape:tag
```

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Contributing
// TODO(user): Add detailed information on how you would like others to contribute to this project

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/).

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/),
which provide a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources until the desired state is reached on the cluster.

### Test It Out
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
